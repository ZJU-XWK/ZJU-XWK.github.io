I am now working toward the Ph.D. degree with the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University (ZJU), supervised by [Prof. Minjian Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0003171) and [Dr. An Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/anliu). Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Zhejiang University. I have also worked as a visiting research assisant at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), collaborated with [Prof. Yik-Chung Wu](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~ycwu/).

My research interest includes **Sparse Signal Processing**, **Optimization Theory**, and **Physical Layer Communication**.

During my undergraduate studies, I concentrated on deep learning in wireless communications, with a particular emphasis on deep joint source and channel coding.
